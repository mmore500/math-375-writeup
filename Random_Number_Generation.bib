It is shown how to generate samples from any distribution whose probability density function is piecewise both absolutely continuous and monotonic on . A special case delivers normal deviates at an average cost of only 4.036 uniform deviates each. This seems more efficient than the Center-Tail method of Dieter and Ahrens, which uses a related, but different, method of generalizing the von Neumann idea to the normal distribution.},

Despite the simplicity of this rule, the time sequences of site values that it yields seem to be completely random. These sequences are analysed by a variety of empirical, combinatorial, statistical, dynamical systems theory and computation theory methods.
